# OS

This is an Operating System Project that is focused on Memory Management.

It includes all the essintial parts of any operating system and some more such as Process Management, Caching, 64 bit Paging, Memory Management, Filing System, bootloader, and so much more.

# Installation
In order to run the operating system you are going to need to follow the instructions below:
1. go into terminal and run the commands:
2. make compile
3. make link
4. make run

# Notes
Notice that while main branch does not contain anything, there a couple of other branches including Develop that together contain all of the old code, the most important of which is the ProcManagement branch, which contains most of the important old code.

This is the older version of the project, we will soon finish the project and upload it in its entirety.
